- **Port Phillip** and **Yarra** also have a large number of listings offering diverse accommodation. Some areas have even fewer listings, likely due to the presence of fewer tourist attractions.
- Regarding guest rating and guest review, with more than 36000 reviews, thanks to its central location and attractions
- There are also some outliers, such as **City of Monash**, which has only 653 listings but over 13,000 reviews with an average rating of **4.6**. This suggests strong guest satisfaction, possibly due to the quality of stays and proximity to universities and business hubs.
